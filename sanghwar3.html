        >JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS,</a
      >
      is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
      World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use
      JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating
      third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
      engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level,
      often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
      standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
      and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
      functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
      programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
      expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
      (DOM).
